      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <h5>There are clear disparities in dermatology in relation to poverty and people of color. First, skin conditions look widely different on fair skin than darker skin-- for example, atopic dermatitis, more commonly known as eczema, presents itself as small bumps or hyperpigmentation that is darker brown, purple, or grey in POC rather than the red, dry, itchy rash that appears on fair skin. However, dermatology textbooks and research have a glaring lack of representation of a variety of skin tones. As a result, dermatologists often have a hard time diagnosing and treating conditions, which then results in a higher incidence of severe cases of a variety of conditions. Additionally, many dermatologists don’t accept Medicaid. This, coupled with the rising cost of treatment, renders care unreachable for those in poverty and the uninsured. A prognosis for a condition should not depend on someone’s ethnicity or financial status. <br> Our mission is to close this gap in dermatologic care for POC by:
      <ul class = "padleft">
        <li>raising awareness for the problem, </li>
        <li>bringing attention to existing organizations fighting for this cause, </li>
        <li>and working with dermatologists and professors to make sure the next generation of healthcare professionals can provide high quality to people from all backgrounds.</li>
      </ul> </h5>
